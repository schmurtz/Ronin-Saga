# Ronin Saga for Foundry VTT
Unofficial simple system for Ronin Saga, which is the property of Kobayashi and Les Livres de l'Ours

Ronin Saga is a classless and level-less RPG with OSR roots, inspired by Japanese folklore. Players take the role of volunteers trying to reunite the Empire, one island at a time. Easy to learn for the players and referees only have to design one island at a time, as one island equals one adventure.
